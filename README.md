# DEFRX
A work in progress remix of SNKRX with mechanics from tower defence / horde defence games. Love the graphics and effects of the original SNKRX and wanted to see if I could make a horde defence roguelite with the beautiful SNKRX aesthetic. This project is being built on top of the source code for SNKRX which can be found here https://github.com/a327ex.

Definitely check out SNKRX if you've never played it, some of the tightest game design out there:
